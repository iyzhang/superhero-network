# The Superhero Network

The Superhero Network is an unaffiliated group of visible, influential and early-stage women CS
researchers that fight against harassment and for a safe environment for everyone in the research community.  The focus will initially be on women, but I would love to eventually expand this to other underrepresented minorities and all PhD students.  The committee will have the following important features:

* **Unaffiliated:** The group will not be sponsored or affiliated by any
  other organization to avoid conflicts of interest.  As demonstrated
  by Sangeetha Jyothi's recent interactions with SIGCOMM CARES and any
  Title IX investigation, the committee cannot try to protect its
  sponsoring org.

* **Diverse:** To avoid further conflicts of interest, we will never
  assign someone to help/give recommendations who is in the same area
  or institution or has any other shared affiliation.  However, we all
  vouch for each other as safe allies and serve as a visible contact
  point within our research communities.  Only after any issue has
  been resolved, the person in the same area may be asked to step in
  and help fix things.

* **Early-stage:** The members must be young enough to be approachable and to have recently
  experienced harassment themselves (no Turing award winners!).
  
* **Influential:** Members must be senior enough to enact change (perhaps
  just before or after tenure?) or know allies/mentors that can implement recommendations.  They must have enough connections to the community be believed by a
  significant set of the senior people.

* **Visible:** People know who you are and can reach you on multiple
  social platforms.  Responsibilities will definitely include
  promoting the processes we put in place to cope with harassment, so
  must be active on Twitter and/or other places that reach many PhD
  students.
  
### Initial proposed tasks
First steps include:

1. Review harassment policies at major conferences that we attend
   (each person reviews a different area from the one that they work
   in).  Find what the concrete steps are for reporting/dealing with
   harassment and whether they are easy to activate (e.g., if I as an
   outside but seasoned researcher cannot find them, then there's a
   problem).  Report suggestions back to research
   communities/conferences to ensure consistency across areas.

2. Start a women's (diversity in genders?) social hour the day before
   the conference starts.  MSR and other companies likely can sponsor this across
   areas, so maybe we can rely on the outreach teams and conference organizers to implement
   this.  We often have diversity workshops but they have a lot of
   talks and not enough just socializing time.  We should have some
   activities to ensure younger women not in the "in crowd" have a
   chance to interact with more senior women, so maybe some
   games/women researchers trivia?!

3. Discuss implementing an opt-in women-only block of rooms at the
   conference. For social networking but also for safety (e.g., I've
   had men at hotels follow me back to my floor in a creepy way).
   Superheros serve as mentors, den mothers? Maybe have an open door
   policy? Also, discuss safety measures for getting from airport to
   hotel when some women arrive alone late at night, some hotels are
   out of the way or in countries where it's not safe to travel alone
   at night as a woman.  Even in Boston or Seattle, I would not walk
   outside alone as a woman without being extremely careful, asking
   women in their early 20s to navigate a foreign country alone is a
   significant barrier to participation for many.

### How To Help
For now, I'm keeping the network extremely small and the goals limited, so there is not much to do! But we will eventually post here ways that companies and individuals can help as allies. Star the repository if you want to follow our journey.
