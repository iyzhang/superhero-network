# The Superhero Network

The Superhero Network is an unaffiliated group of visible, influential and early-stage women CS
researchers that fight against harassment and for a safe environment for everyone in the research community.  The focus will initially be on women, but I would love to eventually expand this to other underrepresented minorities and all PhD students.  The committee will have the following important features:

* **Unaffiliated:** The group will not be sponsored or affiliated by any
  other organization to avoid conflicts of interest.  As demonstrated
  by Sangeetha Jyothi's recent interactions with SIGCOMM CARES and any
  Title IX investigation, the committee cannot try to protect its
  sponsoring org.

* **Diverse:** To avoid further conflicts of interest, we will never
  assign someone to help/give recommendations who is in the same area
  or institution or has any other shared affiliation.  However, we all
  vouch for each other as safe allies and serve as a visible contact
  point within our research communities.  Only after any issue has
  been resolved, the person in the same area may be asked to step in
  and help fix things.

* **Early-stage:** The members must be young enough to be approachable and to have recently
  experienced harassment themselves (no Turing award winners!).
  
* **Influential:** Members must be senior enough to enact change (perhaps
  just before or after tenure?) or know allies/mentors that can implement recommendations.  They must have enough connections to the community be believed by a
  significant set of the senior people.

* **Visible:** People know who you are and can reach you on multiple
  social platforms.  Responsibilities will definitely include
  promoting the processes we put in place to cope with harassment, so
  must be active on Twitter and/or other places that reach many PhD
  students.
  
### Founding Members

* [Irene Zhang](https://irenezhang.net)
  * Title & Affiliation: Principal Researcher at Microsoft Research  
  * Research Area: Systems (SIGOPS, USENIX OSDI)
  * Research focus: I work on operating systems for kernel-bypass and other types of hardware accelerators in the datacenter. I have also worked on mobile systems, distributed systems and networking in the past.
  * Activism: I'm the founder of [Diverse Genders in Research Day](http://wrd.cs.washington.edu/), a day of technical talks by women and diverse genders for diverse genders at the University of Washington (and now others!). The idea behind the event is to recruit more undergraduates of diverse genders to research and PhDs by simply having a safe space to present awesome work and ask questions. Fill that leaky pipeline!!
  * Personal fun: I love to cook and eat, so I'm always up for visiting a new restaurant or talking about a new cooking technique. I also weightlift, play tennis and skate, which are all excellent ways to learn how to fail (and sometimes fall on my face).

### Members

* [Elba Garza](http://www.elbagarza.com) 
  * Title & Affiliation: Graduate Student at Texas A&M University  
  * Research Area: Computer Architecture (Memory Systems, Prediction)
  * Research focus: I work in architectural front-end prediction, e.g. branch prediction, branch target buffer, instruction prefetching, instruction caching.
  * Activism: I'm the co-founder of CASA, or the [Computer Architecture Student Association](http://www.comparchsa.org), an independent student-run organization with the express purpose of developing and fostering a positive and inviting student community within computer architecture. We try to host social events to let student gather and socialize, mentoring activities in and out of conferences, and help run initiatives such as the recent [Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Reading Group](https://www.sigarch.org/advancing-and-promoting-dei-in-computer-architecture-summer-2021-reading-group/) for Summer 2021. 
  * Personal fun: My husband and I like to metal detect to find coins, jewelry, and other lost treasure. We also collect coins, and are all-around OG nerds. And I wouldn't have it any other way!    
* [Eunice Jun](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~emjun/)
  * Title & affiliation: PhD student at University of Washington
  * Research area: HCI, PL/SE (UIST, CSCW, CHI, OOPSLA)
  * Research focus: I work on developing new statistical analysis tools (e.g., domain-specific languages, interfaces) for researchers who may not be statistical experts. I also develop theories for how people analyze data and find ways to improve the validity of analyses. 
  * Activism: My research aims to lower barriers to computing and data science. I also co-organize [Diverse Genders in Research Day](http://wrd.cs.washington.edu/) and have coordinated various mentorship activities for womxn at UW CSE. Years ago, I helped start a [Girls Who Code](https://girlswhocode.com/) chapter at [John Early Middle School](https://johnearly.mnps.org/our_school/school_overview) in Nashville, TN. 
  * Personal fun: I paint, mosaic, dance, and (very poorly) golf. 
  
### How To Help
For now, I'm keeping the network extremely small and the goals limited, so there is not much to do! But we will eventually post here ways that companies and individuals can help as allies. Star the repository if you want to follow our journey.
