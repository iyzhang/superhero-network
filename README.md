# The Superhero Network

The Superhero Network is an unaffiliated group of visible, influential and early-stage women CS
researchers that fight against harassment and for a safe environment for everyone in the research community.  The focus will initially be on women, but I would love to eventually expand this to other underrepresented minorities and all PhD students.  The committee will have the following important features:

* **Unaffiliated:** The group will not be sponsored or affiliated by any
  other organization to avoid conflicts of interest.  As demonstrated
  by Sangeetha Jyothi's recent interactions with SIGCOMM CARES and any
  Title IX investigation, the committee cannot try to protect its
  sponsoring org.

* **Diverse:** To avoid further conflicts of interest, we will never
  assign someone to help/give recommendations who is in the same area
  or institution or has any other shared affiliation.  However, we all
  vouch for each other as safe allies and serve as a visible contact
  point within our research communities.  Only after any issue has
  been resolved, the person in the same area may be asked to step in
  and help fix things.

* **Early-stage:** The members must be young enough to be approachable and to have recently
  experienced harassment themselves (no Turing award winners!). As people become more senior, they are subjected to less harassment, more likely to think that it is not a problem in the community and more likely to know the harasser. Regardless of good intentions, it becomes harder to empathize with new members of the community facing harassment.
  
* **Influential:** Members must be senior enough to enact change (perhaps
  just before or after tenure?) or know allies/mentors that can implement recommendations.  They must have enough connections to the community be believed by a
  significant set of the senior people.

* **Visible:** People know who you are and can reach you on multiple
  social platforms.  Responsibilities will definitely include
  promoting the processes we put in place to cope with harassment, so
  must be active on Twitter and/or other places that reach many PhD
  students.
  
### Senior Members (post-PhD)

* [Irene Zhang](https://irenezhang.net)
  * Title & Affiliation: Principal Researcher at Microsoft Research  
  * Research Area: Systems (SIGOPS, USENIX OSDI)
  * Research focus: I work on operating systems for kernel-bypass and other types of hardware accelerators in the datacenter. I have also worked on mobile systems, distributed systems and networking in the past.
  * Activism: I'm the founder of [Diverse Genders in Research Day](http://wrd.cs.washington.edu/), a day of technical talks by women and diverse genders for diverse genders at the University of Washington (and now others!). The idea behind the event is to recruit more undergraduates of diverse genders to research and PhDs by simply having a safe space to present awesome work and ask questions. Fill that leaky pipeline!!
  * Personal fun: I love to cook and eat, so I'm always up for visiting a new restaurant or talking about a new cooking technique. I also weightlift, play tennis and skate, which are all excellent ways to learn how to fail (and sometimes fall on my face). 
 
* [Sangeetha Abdu Jyothi](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~sabdujyo/)
  * Title & Affiliation: Assistant Professor at the University of California, Irvine  
  * Research Area: Networking (USENIX NSDI, SIGCOMM), Systems (USENIX OSDI, SIGOPS), and ML & Systems (MLSys)
  * Research focus: My current research revolves around Internet resilience under solar superstorms and various challenges at the intersection of systems and ML. I have also worked on cloud resource management and data center networking. 
  * Activism: My most recent experience involved [reporting bias at SIGCOMM HotNets 2020](https://ajsangeetha.wordpress.com/2021/02/18/the-journey-of-a-complaint-at-sigcomm-hotnets-2020/) and fighting against gaslighting and abuse of power at SIGCOMM and ACM. I have also been involved with various associations for women in CS over the years. 
  * Personal fun: I love traveling and hiking. Swimming has a therapeutic effect on me when I am stressed about various things. I also enjoy reading. Thanks to the pandemic, I have recently revived my long-lost hobbies from childhood. I am learning Indian classical music and dance.   

* [Neha Kumar](https://www.nehakumar.org/)
  * Title & Affiliation: Associate Professor at Georgia Tech, where I am jointly appointed at the Sam Nunn School of International Affairs and the School of Interactive Computing. 
  * Research Area: I work at the intersection of human-centered computing and global development and I obtained my Ph.D. in 2013 from UC Berkeley’s School of Information, specializing in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). At Georgia Tech, I proudly lead the TanDEm (short for Technology and Design towards “Empowerment”) lab. Much of our research is focused on health and wellbeing on the margins, centering topics such as gender, stigma, and knowledge production ([read our work](https://nehakumar.org/research)). Prior and current TanDEm students are committed to changing the world—at [inspirit](http://inspiritvr.com/) to continue the work we started on virtual reality and learning, and at [MakerGhat](http://www.makerghat.org/) towards fostering community knowledge networks in under-resourced parts of Mumbai, India.
  * Research Focus: I was trained in computer science, design, and ethnography at UC Berkeley and Stanford University. This training shapes my work, which engages participatory, assets-based approaches towards technology design for/with communities that have historically been underserved. 
  * Activism: I am unreasonably passionate about community-building, and this is what much of my role as President of [SIGCHI](http://sigchi.org/) entails—strengthening our ties as a global HCI community and expanding participation equitably. As Chair of [ACM’s Future of Computing Academy (ACM FCA)](http://www.acm.org/fca), I lead a group of committed computer scientists from across the world, aiming to maximize the impact of computing. As part of my FCA activity, I came to co-host the [X4D Talks](https://x4d.org/), a monthly speaker series that aims to bring 4/5 speakers to present diverse takes on a topic of common interest across research/practice communities that focus on computing and development (or “4D”), e.g., the Future of Work (in February 2021) and Sustainability and Development (in March 2021). I have also been an active organizer and proponent of the [HCI Across Borders](http://hcixb.org/) event series since co-founding it in 2015, which has aimed to promote across-borders collaboration in HCI through the years.

### How To Help
For now, I'm keeping the network extremely small and the goals limited, so there is not much to do! But we will eventually post here ways that companies and individuals can help as allies. Star the repository if you want to follow our journey.
