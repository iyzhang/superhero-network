# The Superhero Network

The Superhero Network is an unaffiliated group of visible, influential and early-stage women CS
researchers that fight against harassment and for a safe environment for everyone in the research community.  The focus will initially be on women, but I would love to eventually expand this to other underrepresented minorities and all PhD students.  The committee has the following important features:

* **Unaffiliated:** The group will not be sponsored or affiliated by any
  other organization to avoid conflicts of interest.  As demonstrated
  by Sangeetha Jyothi's recent interactions with SIGCOMM CARES and any
  Title IX investigation, the committee cannot try to protect its
  sponsoring org.

* **Diverse:** To avoid further conflicts of interest, we will never
  assign someone to help/give recommendations who is in the same area
  or institution or has any other shared affiliation.  However, we all
  vouch for each other as safe allies and serve as a visible contact
  point within our research communities.  Only after any issue has
  been resolved, the person in the same area may be asked to step in
  and help fix things.

* **Early-stage:** The members must be young enough to be approachable and to have recently
  experienced harassment themselves (no Turing award winners!). This makes it easier for us to connect with and mentor people who might have experienced harassment, since they are likely to be grad students or younger.
  
* **Influential:** Members must be senior enough to enact change (perhaps
  just before or after tenure?) or know allies/mentors that can implement recommendations.  They must have enough connections to the community be believed by a
  significant set of the senior people.

* **Visible:** People know who you are and can reach you on multiple
  social platforms.  Responsibilities will definitely include
  promoting the processes we put in place to cope with harassment, so
  must be active on Twitter and/or other places that reach many PhD
  students.
  
### Our Mission
We use research and expertise for prevention and intervention of all forms of harassment in the research community.  We define harassment broadly as any unwelcome behavior that harms the participation of marginalized communities, whether they are underrepresented minorities or PhD students. We are using a data-driven approach to improve conference environments and curb academic bullying. 

### Our projects
Our first project is a longitudinal study of harassment at CS research conferences. We are running this survey annually in coorperation with All In and CHAOSS, two leaders in DEI in open-source communities. We have launched the survey across all USENIX conferences and aim to do so across ACM and SafeToC conferences in the future.
  
### Senior Members (post-PhD)

* [Irene Zhang](https://irenezhang.net)
  * Title & Affiliation: Principal Researcher at Microsoft Research  
  * Research Area: Systems (SIGOPS, USENIX OSDI)
  * Research focus: I work on operating systems for kernel-bypass and other types of hardware accelerators in the datacenter. I have also worked on mobile systems, distributed systems and networking in the past.
  * Activism: I'm the founder of [Diverse Genders in Research Day](http://wrd.cs.washington.edu/), a day of technical talks by women and diverse genders for diverse genders at the University of Washington (and now others!). The idea behind the event is to recruit more undergraduates of diverse genders to research and PhDs by simply having a safe space to present awesome work and ask questions. Fill that leaky pipeline!!
  * Personal fun: I love to cook and eat, so I'm always up for visiting a new restaurant or talking about a new cooking technique. I also weightlift, play tennis and skate, which are all excellent ways to learn how to fail (and sometimes fall on my face).

  * Title & Affiliation: Incoming Assistant Professor at Carnegie Mellon University
  * Research Area: Computer architecture (ISCA, ASPLOS, MICRO, HPCA) and Operating Systems (OSDI, SOSP)
  * Research Focus: My research bridges computer architecture and software systems, demonstrating the importance of that bridge in realizing efficient hyperscale web services via solutions that span the systems stack.
  * Activism: I have been actively working towards improving the enrollment and retention of women in CS. For example, I am actively involved in the Women in Computer Architecture (WiCArch) group, having started the WiCArch webinar series and mentorship program.

  * Title & Affiliation: I am an Assistant Professor in the Paul G. Allen School for Computer Science and Engineering. I was previously an Assistant Professor at the University of Maryland, College Park, where I led the [Battle Data Lab](https://battle-data-lab.cs.umd.edu/).
  * Research Area: My research interests focus on developing interactive data-intensive systems that can aid analysts in performing complex data exploration and analysis.
  * Research Focus: My current research is anchored in the field of databases, but utilizes research methodology and techniques from HCI and visualization to integrate data processing (databases) with interactive interfaces (HCI, visualization).

* [Daphne Yao](https://people.cs.vt.edu/danfeng/)
  * Title & Affiliation: Professor, Virginia Tech
  * Research Area: Security and privacy (ACM CCS/ASIACCS, IEEE SecDev, IEEE S&P, ACSAC)

  * Personal fun: Singing, shopping, walking, and watching TV

* [Elissa Redmiles](https://elissaredmiles.com/)
  * Title & Affiliation: Faculty Member & Research Group Leader, Max Planck Institute for Software Systems
  * Research Area: Security & HCI/Social Science (USENIX Security, IEEE S&P, ACM CCS, ACM CHI, WWW)
  * Research focus: I work on digital security, privacy, and safety for end-users and marginalized groups (low-ses populations, sex workers, etc.). 
  * Activism: I've run a number of CS education and CS curriculum development initiatives for under-represented groups. My research group also specifically focuses on developing the careers of marginalized researchers (marginalized by gender, race/ethnicity, past employment e.g., in sex work).
  * Personal fun: I do a lot of Russian Kettlebells/Olympic Barbell, I'm originally from Colorado and love to hike. I cake decorate and once made a cake shaped like a Patron tequila bottle. I also have a giant fluffy dog, after whom an R package was named (https://github.com/seankross/toffee).

* [Neeraja J. Yadwadkar](https://sites.utexas.edu/neeraja/)
  * Title & Affiliation: Incoming Assistant Professor, University of Texas at Austin
  * Research Area: Cloud Computing Systems and Machine Learning (ML)
  * Research focus: Most of my research straddles the boundaries of Systems and ML. Advances in systems, machine learning, and hardware architectures are about to launch a new era in which we can use the entire cloud as a computer. New ML techniques are being developed for solving complex resource management problems in systems. Similarly, systems research is getting influenced by properties of emerging ML algorithms and evolving hardware architectures. Bridging these complementary fields, my research focuses on using and developing ML techniques for systems and building systems for ML.
  * Activism: I care deeply about diversity and inclusion at all the levels: in my classroom, in my upcoming research group, and in the broader research community. For example, I served as the D&I chair for ACM SoCC'21 with the focus on creating a welcoming environment for eveyone at the conference.
  * Personal fun: I am a Kathak dancer and teacher. I primarily teach 5-9 year olds! Kathak is an Indian classical dance form that is at least 2000 years old!

### How To Help
For now, I'm keeping the network extremely small and the goals limited, so there is not much to do! But we will eventually post here ways that companies and individuals can help as allies. Star the repository if you want to follow our journey.
