I've found many references and diverse efforts while starting up this effort, which I will link here:

* [Report from Ad-hoc ToC committee on harassment](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~irani/ToC_SH_report.pdf)
* [The Diversity of Diversity & Inclusion from SoCC](https://wp.sigmod.org/?p=3009)
* [D&I Statement from ACM](https://www.acm.org/diversity-inclusion)
* [D&I Guidelines from SoCC](http://acmsocc.org/2020/inclusion_and_diversity_in_writing.html)
