# Diversity and Inclusion Best Practices for Conference Organizers

This document presents a list of recommended best practices to improve
the diversity and inclusion of the conference setting for all
minority groups (race, gender, etc.).

## Harassment
These practices are designed to prevent and reduce harassment at
conferences. 

**H1.** Have a clear harassment policy that is easy to find (e.g.,
  printed on the proceedings, linked on the front page website).  It
  must be clear and easy to find.
  
**H2.** The harassment policy should clearly define harassment.

**H3.** The harassment policy should have a clear set of step that can
  easily be triggered by any attendee if they experience harassment.
  
**H4.** Every volunteer participant (e.g., PC chairs, members, panelist, speakers) has been vetted by the governing body (e.g., the [ACM incidents database](https://medium.com/sigchi/the-new-acm-violations-database-528f7d2693a0), the USENIX chair).

## Representation 
These practices are designed to increase representation and visibility of minority groups at conferences.

**R1.** Ensure there is at least one minority member of every part of
  the organizing committees and any visible speakers (e.g., panels,
  etc.).
