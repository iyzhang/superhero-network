## Starting discussion for Codes of Conduct

So, there are a few things that we can start out doing, including finding and writing down every conference code of conduct on our webpage. 

As a starting point for fixing things, I wanted to point out the system that several open-source communities have adopted: [Contributor Covenant: A Code of Conduct for Open Source and Other Digital Commons Communities (contributor-covenant.org)](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/)

The actual code of conduct, which I think has a good example of how important it is to define harassment. And then immediately afterwards, the consequences.
[Contributor Covenant: (contributor-covenant.org)](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/)

Here is the mozilla repo with all of the forms for reporting, since Sangeetha asked about what we should do if we receive a report. I have a meeting set up for Tuesday with Emma Irwin, who seems to have been involved in all of this.
[mozilla/inclusion: Our repository for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion work at Mozilla (github.com)](https://github.com/mozilla/inclusion)

Here are some links from that page on enforcement:

[How We’re Making Code of Conduct Enforcement Real — and Scaling it. | by Emma Irwin | Mozilla Open Innovation | Medium](https://medium.com/mozilla-open-innovation/how-were-making-code-of-conduct-enforcement-real-and-scaling-it-3e382cf94415)

One way to look at what we are doing vs the other group is probably that they are focused somewhat more on prevention and we are looking at enforcement and intervention.
