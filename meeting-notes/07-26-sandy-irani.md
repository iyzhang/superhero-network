### Meeting with Sandy Irani about SafeToC
* SafeToC is a big organization similar to SIG CARES across 15 theory conferences.
* Each conferences have advocates that do a presentation at every conferences and have [other duties](http://safetoc.org/index.php/information-for-toc-advisors/) 
* They have an annual meeting to share experiences across advocates.
* Do not have any enforcement or penalty role, similar to CARES.
* They have a [1 pager on harassment prevention](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iDVnR2f7wUb0TqOwF7-p8dRHShrKf5S8OoMTuZsSX0Q/edit). Should this be distributed at every conference?
* Follow up with Erin Chambers.
